When it comes to social media marketing, Facebook and Instagram are probably the most important two players on the market in these days.<!--more-->

There are more than <a href="https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.7 billion</a> monthly active users on Facebook and <a href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">700 million</a> Instagram users. Almost four times the audience of Instagram however, does not make Facebook better. In many ways, for marketing and advertising purposes, Instagram may deliver better results. Let’s see why:

[sam_pro id=1_1 codes="true"]

At its core, Instagram is a mobile app focused on visual information. Why is this relevant? According to Marketing Land, nearly <a href="https://marketingland.com/facebook-usage-accounts-1-5-minutes-spent-mobile-171561" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of social media time</a> spent in today’s context is spent on mobile devices.

The image depicts how the social media market changed over three years, between 2013 and 2015. No, the data is not irrelevant in 2017 or 2018. It shows a progression that started a few years ago and it is still relevant, as mobile use is growing on a monthly basis.

See the following graphic for a clearer understanding of how Smartphone use (in billions) had been growing over the last years and what we can expect until 2020.

Before getting to our main topic of today’s article, let’s take a look at one of the most<a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/two-college-dropouts-launched-coolest-watch-brand-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> successful stories</a> of Instagram marketing for a product based campaign.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03222910/MVMT.jpg" alt="MVMT" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35357" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.localsuccess.org/profile/jake-and-kramer-mvmt-watches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>

Jake Kassan and Kramer LaPlante met in college as roommates and bonded quickly due to their entrepreneurial dreams. Jake had a little experience in eCommerce while Kramer had some experience in crowdfunding. They combined their skills and started a business in the watch industry.

MVMT, as their business was called, had success on crowdfunding websites and soon they gathered the funds they needed for their startup. Soon, they found a manufacturer to produce their watches on Alibaba and started a Shopify based eCommerce website.

Their first year of business topped $1 million in sales. The next consecutive years brought them more success and got them on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2017/manufacturing-industry/#109cd63b2c1b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes 30 under 30 list</a>. In 2015, their sales jumped to $30 million. The sum doubled in 2016, with more than $60 million in revenue. The two founders expect revenue of no less than $90 million in 2017.

Why are they relevant to this article?

Well, they managed to really get successful after taking their business to Instagram.

They connected with the Millennial audience through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sam_kolder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Kolder</a>, a videographer who traveled the world wearing MVMT watches. Through inspirational posts and a great lifestyle experience, they capture the audience’s attention and obtained 900k followers, many of them became customers. The adventure on Instagram did not stop there. They launched an advertising campaign on Instagram as well, which proved to deliver a 2 times higher engagement rate than any other platform and a 75% stronger brand awareness and brand recall.

Also, “<i>Instagram was not only able to integrate seamlessly into our day-to-day ad management by combining placements, but also improved cost per action by 20%</i>”, Steven Dinelli, Ad Manager at MVMT Watches, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/success/mvmt?locale=sv_SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.

Now, let’s get back to our business. It’s possible that you are already aware of the fact that Instagram allows you to advertise on their platform.

There are two ways of doing it, through<a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/113202181-the-beginners-guide-to-advertising-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Instagram Ads</a> and through Instagram Stories Ads.

Today, I am going to talk about Stories Ads and guide you through the entire process of using this feature for advertising purposes.

<h2>What are Instagram Stories & Why They Work So Well</h2>

Instagram Stories was <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/introducing-instagram-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in the summer of 2016 but it became a hit over the course of 2017. The feature is similar to Snapchat, another popular app available in today’s context and focuses on ephemeral visual content. This means that users are able to create stories based on a series of images and videos, share them with friends and followers over a specific period of time. After the exact period of 24 hours, these stories are deleted.

By June 2017, Instagram Stories had over <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/6/20/15836248/instagram-stories-250-million-users-snapchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">250 million</a> daily active users, more than half of the total number of users of this entire social media channel. These numbers give us good reasons to pay attention to Stories and consider using the feature in our marketing campaigns.

<a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/announcing-15-million-business-profiles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 million businesses</a> are already registered with Instagram through business profiles out of which, 1 million per month use the advertising features.

However, I know many will ask: “Why choosing to post ephemeral content and not regular posts?”; “Why invest in ads that will disappear in 24 hours never to be seen again?”

Well, as strange as it may sound to some of you out there, ephemeral content may prove to be as effective as the regular posts. In some cases, depending on the nature of your eCommerce business, they may prove to be even better.

The answer to your questions is “authenticity.” There was a <a href="http://www.cis.cornell.edu/cornell-research-study-shows-how-snapchat-changing-way-we-share-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> performed at Cornell University where a series of students were interviewed and asked why they like Snapchat. They said that the ephemeral content was fun but at the same time, it made them feel like the interaction was less formal.

Snapchat is in many ways similar to Instagram Stories and this is why the study also applies here. There is an authenticity attached to the ephemeral status of these posts that comes directly from their less formal state.

Brands are sometimes blamed for trying too much. They are blamed for a lack of authenticity in their marketing and advertising campaigns. This issue may lead to a loss of trust among customers and fans and ultimately, a drop in sales.

Nobody expects you to spend days or weeks designing the slides of a story that will be automatically deleted after 24 hours. Therefore, as a marketer, you get to transmit a more authentic message due to the spontaneity of the Stories. You get to test ideas you are not absolutely sure about, test your creativity and most of all, act on quick ideas and sometimes on instinct.

<h2>What are Instagram Stories Ads</h2>

According to <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-stories-available-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram’s business blog</a>,

<blockquote>Ads in stories let your business use targeting and reach capabilities that make your ads personally relevant to the people you want to reach. That, paired with measurement tools giving you the confidence to know it works, is unmatched in a stories experience.</blockquote>

The feature was launched at first for only 30 lucky brands, in January 2017. A couple of months later, after more than positive feedback from the testers, Instagram Stories Ads was officially launched for all members of the social media platform.

Since March 2017, Stories Ads were officially launched for all businesses. Now the <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/welcoming-1-million-advertisers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 million</a> advertisers that are active on Instagram now have two methods of placing their ads.

Take for example MOEN, the most popular faucet brand in North America. According to Instagram, their approach to Stories Ads resulted in <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>45 percent</i></a><i> more impressions and a fresh, new way for the brand to create engaging content more quickly and efficiently”.</i>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03223128/video-ad.png" alt="video ad" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35358" />

<h2>Snapchat Ads versus Instagram Stories Ads</h2>

According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwincunningham/2017/04/25/snapchat-vs-instagram-stories-what-business-owners-need-to-know/#7aa942385fe2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>, Snapchat is more popular among teens and people between 18 to 24 years of age. On the other hand, Instagram reaches a more diverse audience and it performs well with people between the ages 30 to 49 years old. Remember these facts as they are important in eCommerce marketing. The younger your audience is, <em>the less likely it is that they will buy something</em>.

<h2>Why use Instagram Stories Ads</h2>

As I have already said, for eCommerce businesses, Instagram Stories help them connect with a diverse audience of all ages. Moreover, due to the fact that you are publishing ephemeral content, your audience is more likely to pay attention to your ads. Also, the format of stories keeps viewers from tapping away from the "storified" content.

Here’s a good example of how Instagram Stories Ads should look like if you want to showcase your products and your promotions. Sales and discounts are immediate attention grabbers, therefore, use them in your ads.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03223429/40-percent-off-express.png" alt="40 percent off express" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35359" />

<h2>Design your Ads</h2>

Now that we know why Instagram ads and Instagram Stories Ads may be effective for your eCommerce business, it’s time to take a step further and consider designing your ads.

First, you need to know that there are two types of ads you can post inside Instagram Stories: videos and images. While videos can be no longer than 15 seconds, a static ad will be displayed for only<a href="https://business.instagram.com/a/storiesads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 5 seconds</a>. It’s not a long time and this is why you need to design it so that it will be able to grab the viewer’s attention immediately.

Whether you choose video or photo, the accepted format is a standard 9:16 full screen vertical with a recommended resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels.

The minimum accepted resolution is 600 x 1067 pixels. Also, keep in mind that the recommended file types are .mp4 and .mov for video ads, .jpg and .png for photo ads.

The maximum file sizes should not exceed 30 MB for photos and 4 GB for videos.

<h3>Recommended tools for maximum efficiency</h3>

In order to set up your ad banner, you will have to go to the Facebook Ads Manager. However, before doing that, you need to have a working banner or video to share online. As expected, you don’t need to invest significant time and money in your designs. They will be deleted in just one day and therefore, you might want instead to try new ideas. Act on inspiration. Act on impulse. Be creative and try to think outside the box.

For maximum efficiency, the following tools are recommended:

<ol>

<h2>Connect Instagram with the Facebook Ad Manager</h2>

In order to get access to the Facebook Ad manager, you will need first to connect your Instagram account to your Facebook page.

Go to your Facebook page and click on the “Settings” button from the top right corner. Remember that you have to go to the Facebook page and not the Facebook account. From the left menu then, select Instagram.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03223651/Settings-Instagram.png" alt="Settings Instagram" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35362" />

The next panel allows you to log into your Instagram account and complete the integration with your Facebook page.

Then, you can go to the Facebook Ad Manager interface, available in the drop-down menu of your Facebook Account or Facebook Page, in the top right corner of the screen.

<h2>Launch your Campaign</h2>

First, you get to select your objective. You have three main categories to choose from: Awareness, Consideration and Conversion. Most of the eCommerce campaign will focus on the third option but depending on your goals, you may also choose something else.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03223901/Marketing-objective.png" alt="Marketing objective" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35364" />

Next, if you don’t already have an Ad Account, you are going to set up one. Otherwise, you cannot proceed further.

Finally, choose the type of promotion, select the audience, the ad placements, and the budget. See the following Screenshots for a clearer image of what the Ads Manager interface looks and feels like.

First, choose the website or app you want to promote.

Then, target your ads to specific audiences, based on your marketing strategy.

The next step is to select your ad placements. In this case, select Instagram Stories. You will notice that once you check this option, all other options will become unavailable. There are no other full-screen ads.

Finally, you will get to choose the ad format, upload your files and specify your links.

<h2>How to use Instagram Stories Ads and why</h2>

Like any other marketing or advertising campaign, the one you will undergo through Instagram Stories can be setup to suit multiple goals. Let’s take a look at some of these options and why they may be beneficial for your business. Also, we are going to take a quick look at some of the Instagram Stories Ads success stories, to better understand how these benefits look in real life scenarios.

<h3>Why invest in brand awareness?</h3>

More than half of marketers admit they are<a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Majority-of-Marketers-Say-More-Brand-Awareness-Efforts/1011202" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> planning</a> to invest more in brand awareness. They are doing it because a strong brand attracts more customers. At the same time, you need your audience to know about you, know what you have to offer and who you are. They need to trust you in order to become regulars - but before trust, comes awareness. Trust is then built through intense commitment to quality of service and constant communication with your customers.

In short, you will increase customer loyalty, your visibility and your impact on the targeted audience. However, the ultimate goal is to increase your market lead. The more people know about you, the higher the market lead is. And, when a market lead is high, the sales potential increases. Offer the people a positive experience when they make a purchase and they will continue to spread awareness of your brand.

Here's a real life example:

A great example in this context comes from <a href="https://www.yoox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YOOX</a>, an online store for fashion, design and art. They wanted to position themselves as a top destination for stylish shoppers. To this end, they started a new Instagram Stories Ads campaign that proved to be quite successful.

How did they do it and what were the results? For their Stories Ads campaign, YOOX decided to adapt a TV spot into a video ad that was targeted to men and women ages 25 to 44 years old. Also, they selected their demographics based on interests, which in case were fashion and shopping. The result was a significant <a href="https://business.instagram.com/success/yoox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-point</a> growth in brand awareness and an 11-point increase in ad recall.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03224401/Bouncing-balls.png" alt="Bouncing balls" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35370" />

<h3>Increase in sales</h3>

Let’s face it: this is the first thing you think about, as a marketer for an eCommerce business.

Here's another real life example:

Maybe you’ve already heard about <a href="http://www.virginholidays.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virgin Holidays</a>, the leading transatlantic tour operator from the UK. The goal of their Instagram Stories Ads campaign was to drive conversions in-store and online. They wanted to increase sales but they also set a goal on growing brand awareness, two things that go hand in hand.

Their campaign ran for only 3 days in March 2017. Through their video ads, they managed to successfully bring to life some popular landscapes from New York City, San Francisco and Las Vegas, 3 of the top destinations from their travel offer. The video ad introduced the viewer to the cities through powerful and intense depictions of places and people that were supposed to make us feel like we are already there. Ultimately, the campaign resulted in a “<a href="https://business.instagram.com/success/virgin-holidays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.84X increase</a> in return on ad spend, and the cost per view also fell by 10%.”

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03224514/Virgin-Holidays-NYC.png" alt="Virgin Holidays NYC" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35371" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/433382740093484/videos/1316151471816602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>

<h3>Special Promotions</h3>

Let’s say your main focus is not on awareness or on immediate sales. For instance, you might want to promote a dedicated app for your website, or other special promotion that may lead finally to the aforementioned goals. Can you do it through Instagram Stories Ads? Well, of course you can. In fact, there are success stories in this area as well from which you can learn a lot. I will present an example soon but first, let’s talk a bit about the benefits of a dedicated app for an eCommerce website.

<h3>Why invest in promoting an app?</h3>

A mobile app will allow you to push notifications and thus, keep your audience connected with your brand and store. It will also allow you to make your store more mobile friendly and update it for mobile use for maximum readability and functionality. Considering that <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-better-for-e-commerce-stores-native-mobile-apps-or-web-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">90% of the time spent on mobile</a> by the average user is on apps, the idea of building your own dedicated app may not seem bad at all.

Real life example:

This real-life example comes from <a href="http://www.hopper.com/%E2%80%8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopper</a>, a travel company that built a mobile app that was launched in 2015. Their campaign on Instagram Stories Ads targeted “millennials,” a group known for making purchases through mobile apps. They promoted hundreds of deals every week through illustration depicting dreamy destinations and locations from all around the world. While other travel companies focus on people who are ready to make purchases immediately, Hopper targets a young audience that likes to plan ahead. Their app keeps them engaged by sending price alerts when the prices drop through push notifications.

The results were better than expected. They reached more than 7.5 million people in North America and the Stories Ads generated a <a href="https://business.instagram.com/success/hopper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">65% increase</a> in app installs and over 80% increase in bookings for new users.

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03224621/Hopper-ad.png" alt="Hopper ad" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35372" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/433382740093484/videos/1478501932248221/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Source</em></a></p>

<h3>Generate Leads</h3>

What does “leads generation” means? Well, this is a term usually used in marketing that refers mainly to the initiation of the consumer’s interest or inquiry in your products or services. It’s a very important term and consequently, a very important process in attracting more customers or gathering important demographic information that may lead eventually to new customers.

“Lead generation is the process of attracting and converting strangers and prospects into someone who has indicated interest is your company's product or service.” (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubspot</a>)

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ceblog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03224658/Attract-Convert-Close-Delight.png" alt="Attract Convert Close Delight" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35373" />

<h3>Why invest in lead generation?</h3>

Most of the people who want to make a purchase, are halfway there when they contact a salesperson. A lead generation campaign, grabs the audience’s attention long before they know they are ready to buy your products. Thus, it can accelerate sales and consequently, increase profits by decreasing the time between product awareness and the decision to acquire it.

Real life example:

This example comes from Mercedes-Benz. The campaign they underwent on Instagram Stories Ads was meant to increase lead generation for their new C-Class Cabriolet model. To this end, they focused their ads on the enjoyment of open-top driving. While the campaign was intended at first as an experiment, <a href="https://business.instagram.com/success/mercedes-benz-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the story</a> offered its audience a seamless experience, while showcasing the car in an exciting and highly aspirational way”.

What were the results? Well, Mercedes-Benz managed to achieve a 9-point increase in ad recall, a 3-point increase in message association with their exclusive tagline and a reach of more n=than 2.6 million Instagram users.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Although a new feature on Instagram, Stories managed to grow in popularity faster than expected.

This article was meant to shed some light on how Instagram Stories work, why they are a good choice for a marketer and how you can benefit from them at the same time. I hope my advice will help you get the most out of your campaign which eventually will prove to be effective and profitable as well. Remember, however, that regardless of how successful your campaign is, you will have to work even more in order to turn your seasonal or first-time shoppers into regular customers.
